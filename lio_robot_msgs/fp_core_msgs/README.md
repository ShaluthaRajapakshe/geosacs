# F&P CORE MESSAGES

Author: [F&P Robotics AG](https://www.fp-robotics.com)

Compatible with myP version 1.6.

Message and service types to read data from the myP core and access selected functions through ROS services.

## Installation

Clone this repo into the `src` directory of your catkin workspace and build it, either through `catkin_make` or `catkin build`. Certain add-ons of myP advertise their own services and therefore require additional message and service types. Please have a look at these repos:

- [fp_learning_msgs](https://github.com/fp-robotics/fp_learning_msgs) (if you are using the myP Learning Module in addition)

## Using myP's ROS module

Please refer to the __**myP User Manual 1.6**__ for detailed instructions and examples on how to use ROS with myP. Should you find any issues, please report them to [support@fp-robotics.com](support@fp-robotics.com).
